# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

memo
Hooks の理解

- useState
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  todos の中身を追加、削除など更新したい場合に setTodos を使って todos を更新できる

変数を監視して、更新された場合のみ再レンダリングできるので、無駄なレンダリングを減らすことができる
初期値を表示することができる

- useRef
  要素の取得ができる

- スプレット構文
  ...prevTodos

オブジェクトにおけるスプレット構文の追加の方法
setTodos((prevTodos) => {
return [...prevTodos, { id: uuidv4(), name: name, completed: false }];
});

- uuid
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid

直接値を変えるのは良くないため、一旦コピーして変数に入れ直して更新する

関数
map 1 つ 1 つ渡していく
find 　条件式が true であれば、それだけを変数の中に入れていく
filter 　条件式が false であれば、それだけを変数の中に入れていく
